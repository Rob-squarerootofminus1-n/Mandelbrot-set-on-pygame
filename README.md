# Mandelbrot-set-on-pygame
My first Mandelbrot set code. 
On a unsuitable library, with an unstable window (don't try to make the window bigger or smaller); 
a very slow programm and also no nuance for the different iterations. 
A very bad program, I already post one way better. But hey, at least you can change the colours. 
And nostalgia's my bff.

I don't think you have questions for this shitty program, but in case I'm wrong, contact me at robin.dallemagne.rd@gmail.com
